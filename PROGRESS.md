### M1.2: Data Models ⏳ (In Progress)
**Status**: 90% Complete
**Duration**: ~45 minutes

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Created `Category.swift` - 6 knowledge categories with colors and icons
- ✅ Created `Card.swift` - Main knowledge card model
- ✅ Created `User.swift` - User profile and settings
- ✅ Created `Achievement.swift` - Gamification achievements
- ✅ Created `Quiz.swift` - Quiz questions and results
- ✅ All models conform to Identifiable, Codable, Equatable
- ✅ Mock data extensions created (wrapped in `#if DEBUG`)

**Pending**:
- ⏳ Add models to Xcode project file
- ⏳ Create unit tests for all models
- ⏳ Verify encoding/decoding works correctly

**Files Created**:
```
DailyQuipAI/Core/Models/
├── Category.swift       (2.2 KB) - 6 categories with UI properties
├── Card.swift          (3.0 KB) - Knowledge card model
├── User.swift          (2.5 KB) - User profile & settings
├── Achievement.swift   (4.9 KB) - 15+ achievement types
└── Quiz.swift          (4.6 KB) - Quiz questions & results
```

**Models Summary**:
1. **Category** - 6 types: History, Science, Art, Life, Finance, Philosophy
2. **Card** - ID, title, category, images, content, tags, difficulty (1-5)
3. **User** - Profile, interests, streak, total cards, settings
4. **UserSettings** - Notifications, theme, daily goal
5. **Achievement** - 15+ achievement types with unlock logic
6. **QuizQuestion** - Multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-blank
7. **QuizResult** - Score, percentage, grade calculation

## Next Steps 📋

### Immediate (Next 1-2 hours)
1. **Add models to Xcode project** (if not auto-detected)
2. **Create unit tests for models** (M1.2 completion requirement)
3. **Verify project builds successfully**

### Today (M1.3 - Core Data Storage)
1. Setup Core Data stack
2. Create repository protocols
3. Implement CRUD operations
4. Write storage layer tests

### This Week
- Complete Module 1 (Core Foundation)
- Complete Module 2 (Design System & UI)

## Metrics

**Code Quality**:
- Lines of Code: ~500
- Files Created: 9
- Test Coverage: 0% (tests not yet written)
- Build Status: Pending verification

**Time Tracking**:
- M1.1: ~30 minutes ✅
- M1.2: ~45 minutes ⏳
- Total: 1h 15m / 46h estimated for Week 1

---

## Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- Using pure Swift structs for models (not Core Data entities yet)
- Models are immutable by default (use `mutating` for changes)
- Mock data only in `#if DEBUG` blocks (production safety)
- All models are value types (struct) for thread safety

### Following Guidelines
- ✅ English-only code and comments
- ✅ No fallback/mock data in production code
- ✅ Following modular architecture
- ✅ All models are testable (protocols ready for M1.3)

### Blocked Items
- None currently

**Next Milestone**: M1.2 Unit Tests (30-60 minutes)
