# iPad Optimization Guide

## Overview

DailyQuipAI is now optimized for iPad with adaptive layouts and responsive design that takes advantage of the larger screen.

## Key iPad Enhancements

### 1. Adaptive Card Sizing

**iPhone:**
- Cards fill the width with standard padding
- Corner radius: 40pt
- Title font: 28pt

**iPad:**
- Cards are centered with max width of 600pt (70% of screen width)
- Corner radius: 48pt (more prominent on larger screen)
- Title font: 36pt
- Body text: 20pt (vs 16pt on iPhone)
- Category tags: 16pt (vs 13pt on iPhone)

### 2. Responsive Typography

All text scales appropriately:
- **Card Titles**: 28pt → 36pt
- **Body Text**: 16pt → 20pt
- **Category Tags**: 13pt → 16pt
- Better readability on larger displays

### 3. Grid Layouts

**Category Selection:**
- iPhone: 2 columns
- iPad: 3 columns
- More efficient use of screen space

### 4. Centered Content

Cards are centered on iPad for:
- Better visual focus
- Comfortable viewing distance
- Professional appearance
- Prevents excessive stretching

### 5. Optimized Aspect Ratios

- iPad cards maintain 75% height ratio
- Preserves card proportions
- Prevents awkward stretching
- Clean, elegant presentation
