# Recent Improvements Summary

## 1. Fixed Card Swipe Navigation

### Problem
- Up/down swipes caused cards to disappear without showing the next card
- Card UI state (flip, offset) persisted when moving to next card

### Solution
- Added `.id(cardID)` to force view reset when card changes (KnowledgeCardView.swift:73)
- Added `.onChange(of: cardID)` to reset all card states (flip, rotation, offset) (KnowledgeCardView.swift:74-82)

### Result
âœ… Up/down swipes now properly navigate to next card with clean UI state

## 2. Category-Based Card Management

### Problem
- Cards were not organized by category
- Switching categories required fetching entirely new batches
- No way to view cards from a specific category

### Solution

#### Architecture Changes (DailyCardsViewModel.swift)

**1. Category-Based Storage**
```swift
private var allCardsByCategory: [Category: [Card]] = [:]
```
- All cards organized by category in memory
- Persistent cache across app sessions

**2. Smart Category Switching**
```swift
func switchCategory(_ category: Category?) async
```
- Instantly shows existing cards for that category
- Automatically fetches more if count < 5
- Appends new cards to existing category cards

**3. Category Filter UI**
```swift
CategoryFilterBar(
    selectedCategory: viewModel.selectedCategory,
    onSelectCategory: { category in ... }
)
```
- Horizontal scrollable category chips
- "All" button to show all categories
- Visual indication of selected category

#### Flow Example

**Initial Load:**
```
User opens app
  â†“
Load 10 cards (mixed categories)
  â†“
Organize: History[3], Science[4], Art[3]
  â†“
Display: All 10 cards
```

**User Selects "Science":**
```
User taps Science chip
  â†“
Show existing 4 Science cards
  â†“
Auto-fetch 10 more Science cards (4 < 5 threshold)
  â†“
Display: 14 Science cards total
```

**User Switches to "History":**
```
User taps History chip
  â†“
Show existing 3 History cards
  â†“
Auto-fetch 10 more History cards
  â†“
Display: 13 History cards total
```

**User Selects "All":**
```
User taps All chip
  â†“
Show all cards: History[13] + Science[14] + Art[3]
  â†“
Display: 30 cards total
```

### Key Features

1. **Persistent Category Cards**
   - Cards accumulate per category
   - Switching back shows all previously fetched cards
   - No re-fetching on category switch

2. **Smart Fetching**
   - Auto-fetch when category has < 5 cards
   - Fetches 10-card batches per category
   - Appends to existing cards (no replacement)

3. **Cache Management**
   - All category cards cached together
   - Cache structure: `[String: [Card]]`
   - Survives app restarts
   - Expires daily

### UI Components

**CategoryFilterBar** (DailyCardsView.swift:129-159)
- Horizontal scrollable row
- Shows "All" + 6 category chips
- Highlights selected category

**CategoryFilterChip** (DailyCardsView.swift:161-182)
- Icon + category name
- Blue when selected
- Gray when unselected

### Cache Structure

**Before:**
```json
{
  "cachedDailyCards": [Card, Card, Card, ...]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "cachedDailyCards": {
    "History": [Card, Card, ...],
    "Science": [Card, Card, ...],
    "Art": [Card, Card, ...]
  }
}
```

### Benefits

âœ… **No Redundant Fetching**: Category cards accumulate
âœ… **Instant Category Switch**: Show existing cards immediately
âœ… **Smart Auto-Fetch**: Only fetch when needed (< 5 cards)
âœ… **Better UX**: Users can explore by category without losing progress
âœ… **Efficient API Usage**: Batch fetching with intelligent caching

## Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Default batch size**: 10 cards
- **Auto-fetch threshold**: < 5 cards per category
- **Batch fetch size**: 10 cards per category
- **Max tokens**: 8000 (supports ~10-15 cards per batch)

### Adjust Auto-Fetch Threshold

```swift
// In DailyCardsViewModel.swift:120
if existingCards.count < 5 {  // Change threshold here
    await fetchCardsForCategory(category)
}
```

### Adjust Batch Size Per Category

```swift
// In DailyCardsViewModel.swift:141
let cardCount = 10  // Change batch size here
```

## Testing Checklist

## Summary

These improvements transform card navigation and organization:

**Before:**
